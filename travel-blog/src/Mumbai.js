                    My first day in Bombay began with a visit to <b>the Gateway of India</b>, one of the most famous historical landmarks in the city.
                    Overlooking the Arabian Sea, it was built during the 20th century in honor of King George V and Queen Mary's visit to India.

                    No visit to Mumbai is complete without trying the local cuisine. <b>I indulged in Vada Pav, a popular street food</b>, which is essentially a spicy potato fritter sandwiched between buns, served with tangy chutneys.

            <h3><u>The Rich Lives of Mumbai</u></h3>
                 On my third day, I was captivated by the opulence and architectural elegance of South Bombay. The area is a testament to colonial grandeur, showcasing <b>an array of Victorian, Art Deco, and Gothic buildings</b>. Here, the legacy of Bombay's golden era is preserved in structures like the Bombay High Court and the University of Mumbai,each telling a story of a rich historical tapestry.

                    An evening stroll along <b>Marine Drive, also known as the Queen's Necklace</b>, was truly mesmerizing. The crescent-shaped boulevard lights up beautifully at night, offering stunning views of the city's skyline.

                    Another highlight was a visit to <b>the Elephanta Caves</b>, located on an island about 11 km northeast of the Harbor. The rock-cut caves are primarily dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and showcase Indiaâ€™s rich cultural heritage.
