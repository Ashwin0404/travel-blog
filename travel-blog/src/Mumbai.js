                    <p>My first day in Bombay began with a visit to <b>the Gateway of India</b>, one of the most famous historical landmarks in the city.
                    Overlooking the Arabian Sea, it was built during the 20th century in honor of King George V and Queen Mary's visit to India.</p>

                    No visit to Mumbai is complete without trying the local cuisine. <b>I indulged in Vada Pav, a popular street food</b>, which is essentially a spicy potato fritter sandwiched between buns, served with tangy chutneys.

            <h3><u>The Rich Lives of Mumbai</u></h3>
                 On my third day, I was captivated by the opulence and architectural elegance of South Bombay. The area is a testament to colonial grandeur, showcasing <b>an array of Victorian, Art Deco, and Gothic buildings</b>. Here, the legacy of Bombay's golden era is preserved in structures like the Bombay High Court and the University of Mumbai,each telling a story of a rich historical tapestry.
